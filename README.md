FurrySkeleton WebApp Framework
==============================

This is a code skeleton for quick-starting development of Bootstrap+PHP+MySQL web apps using good practices and security conserns

The intension of it is to stop wasting time with setting up a new projects basic structure and functionalities. It comes out-of-the-box with Jasny Bootstrap, and APIs for database `CRUD` using and dumps, `template system`, sending `mails`, managing `sessions` & `user-roles`.

I'm constantly adding more libraries to core functionalities as I need to use them in my projects. Feel free to ask or add more :)

Functionalities:
- [x] MySQL CRUD
- [x] MySQL database dump for backups
- [x] Contact form, mail handling
- [x] Basic template system
- [x] Input Sanitizing for SQL Injections and XSS
- [x] PHPass password hashing
- [x] PHP Sessions using (auto-expire included) and protection against Session Fixation Attacks)
- [x] Easy to define User Roles and restrictions

Everything set for quick and easy use.
